# shiitake_app
shiitake! is a simple web app that allows a visitor to personalize funny messages that would typically contain curse words, except those specific words will have been replaced with generic sayings that are not considered profane at all (e.g. "ducking," "shiitake mushrooms!", "fudgesicle!", and more). The visitor will be able to share their personalized message via email, social media, text message, or via copy and paste.
